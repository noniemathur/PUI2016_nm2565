# Assignment 2
I worked on this assignment with Santiago Carrillo and Laura Gladson. Santiago helped us in creating the alias and setting its path and Laura helped us in making the folder to create this readme file. 
To set up the environment, I first went on compute and then made a new directory called PUI2016_nm2565. Once that was done, I went on nano .bashrc and wrote the commands in the picture below.

After this, this is how the pwd and pui2016 worked
