#Homework 2 

For this assignment, I again worked with Santiago Carrilo and Laura Gladson. However, this time, I also got a chance to discuss it with Alexey Kalinin, Kristin Korsberg and Felipe Diego Gonzalez. 
Felipe was very helpful in helping me out with the Python scripts for assignment 1. Laura, Santiago and Kristin helped me out with Assignment 2 and 3. 
I and Santiago assisted Kristin with the format of Assignment 2. Adriano Mitsuo Yoshino helped me with Assignment 3 â€“ he helped me with deleting the columns of my table.
