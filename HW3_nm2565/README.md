#Homework 3
For this homework, we again worked in groups. 
For assignment 2 and 3, we we made a group of 5 - I worked with Santiago, Laura, Alexey and Maisha. We worked together â€“ defining our hypothesis, and then later plotted the graphs (for assignment 2) and conducted the Z test (for assignment 3)
