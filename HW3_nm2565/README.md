#Homework 3
For this homework, we again worked in groups. 
For assignment 2 and 3, we we made a group of 5 - I worked with Santiago, Laura, Alexey and Maisha. We worked together â€“ defining our hypothesis, and then later plotted the graphs (for assignment 2) and conducted the Z test (for assignment 3). For Assignment 1, Sanitago and I worked together closely, Laura and Alexey helped me with the statistical concepts.
Felipe also helped me with the graph plotting conecpt. We used the website scipy.org for the syntax of the all the distributions.
