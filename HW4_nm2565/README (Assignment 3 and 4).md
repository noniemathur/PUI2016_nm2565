##Assignment 3
For this assignment, I worked closely with Laura Gladson. The skeleton notebook provided by Dr. Bianco was very helpful for the z tests. However, Laura helped me a lot with understanding the concept of the chi square. Alexey also helped me with it. I also helped Santiago Carrilo with the assignment.

##Assignment 4
For this assignment, I worked with Laura and Krsity, with all three of us working together specially for the Pearson correlation test. Here, again Laura and Kristy helped me with the statistical concepts. I later helped Santiago too.
