# Assignment 2
I worked with Santiago on this assignment. We chose Chi square and Correlation tests  for this assignment and connected them with two seperate researches. 

| **Statistical Analyses	|  IV(s)  |  IV type(s) |  DV(s)  |  DV type(s)  |  Control Var | Control Var type  | Question to be answered | _H0_ | alpha | link to paper **| 
|:----------:|:----------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|:------------|:------------- |:------------------|:----:|:-------:|:-------|
Chi Square	| 1, Visual Perception (Ranks of Values) | Categorical | 1, Mental imagery (Mental neglect)| Categorical | - | - | 	Is there a difference in the frequency of both the kinds of tests (preceptual and representational)? | The two distinct forms of representational neglect do not exist | 0.01 | [Representational neglect after a right hemisphere lesion](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0067390#s3) |
  |||||||||
|Correlation |Correlation coefficient of transcriptional profile | Continuos | Correlation coefficient of pathway profile |  Continous |- | - | Are molecular cancer subtypes with similar clinical outcome correlated to transcriptional profile and/or pathway profile? | Molecular cancer subtypes with similar clinical outcome are not correlated to transcriptional profile and/or pathway profile | 0.05 | [Correlation Analysis connecting Cancer Subtypes](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0069747#s5)
