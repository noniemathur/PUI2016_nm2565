My Citi Bike group - Nonie, Santiago, Laura, Alexey and Maisha worked together on Friday and decided the test we would conduct, by looking at the peer suggestions we all recieved. We then got together, performed the Z test and then worked on the Authorea document by adding our own comments and edits.


# FBB

your authorea article is set to private and I cannot see it.  laura changed the setting after I asked you all to.

the analysis is good, but you did not explit any of the capabilities of authorea: you did not put the plots in the article context, but put them all at the end, you did not write the equations for H0 Ha (or the z test, which is also an easy equation) you did not have the authors listed as authors so the paper does not link you your accounts and is not in your portfolio, etc. look at the comments int he paper itself.
