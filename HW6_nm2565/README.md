## Assignment 1
For this assignment, I worked with Santiago, Laura and Alexey. Poonah and Kristi also helped me with the assignment, especially in plotting the graphs. 

## Assignment 2
My Citi Bike group - Nonie, Santiago, Laura, Alexey and Maisha worked together on Friday and decided the test we would conduct, by looking at the peer suggestions we all recieved. We then got together, performed the Z test and then worked on the Authorea document by adding our own comments and edits.
