#Peer Review 1
For this assignment, I am reviewing the plot made by Henry for homework 7. He used a dataset which described the topic transition before and after the Taiwan Presidential elections. 

Clarity: In terms of clarity, whereas all the plots have a readable legend, they do not have the plot, the X and the Y axis labels. This makes the plot a little hard to understand as I am not clear what they are conveying here.  

Aesthetics: In terms of aesthetics, all the plots generated are pretty clear and understandable, in terms of the choice of the colors used. The values plotted (the intervals in the X and the Y values) are also chosen appropriately. Henry’s use of ‘nbviewer’ tool can tell us the value of each and every point which makes it so much clearer. 

Honesty: From my understanding of the plot I gather that it represents ‘social hearing’ around the Presidential elections in Taiwan. I personally believe that in the light of the current presidential pomp and show of the elections here in USA, this is a great way to represent people’s reaction to the results/process. This tool can also be used in urban studies, e.g. public reaction to an open space design.
