#Peer Review 2
For this assignment, I am reviewing the plot made by Yuan Shi for homework 7. The dataset used here gives the number of water quality complaints by zip code. 
A second notebook had images loaded in it.

Clarity: In terms of clarity, the plot has a readable legend, the plot title and the axes labels. This information tells us exactly what the plot shows and conveys the story. A suggestion here would be to add a caption to the plot which could briefly describe what we gather from the plot â€“ which areas have the maximum number of water complaints and what can be done (eg. bringing up this point during the community board meetings etc.).

Aesthetics: In terms of aesthetics, the plot generated is pretty clear and understandable, in terms of the choice of the colors used. The values plotted (the intervals in the X values) are also chosen appropriately. However, the zip codes are listed as float, they can be converted into integers (without the decimal point).  

Honesty: Displaying information like this is a very effective way of communicating a problem as important as this one. This kind of information can be easily made accessible to the public as well the city agencies to identify the areas that need attention.
