#LAB
I started the lab in the class with Santiago and Kristi, however, I later finished the homework with Achilles and Aaron. They helped me with the concepts and the code. Vishwajeet also helped me with a few querries that I had. 

#Peer Review
I finished the peer review on my own. Santiago helped me with the forking process.
